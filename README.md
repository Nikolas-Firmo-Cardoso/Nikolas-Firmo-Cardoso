### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<I'm Eduardo, and my focus is to be a web developer programmer that can beat good challanges and solve problems. I'm passionate about technology and how it can be an incredible tool to change people's lives.

I'm currently a student at Trybe, which is a programming school that teaches us how to learn the right way and how to solve problems using programming logic with baby steps.
I am currently in the backend module of the Trybe course where I will learn technologies such as Docker, MySQL, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, Typescript and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
