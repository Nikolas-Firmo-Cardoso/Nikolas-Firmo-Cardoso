### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nikolas, and my focus is to be a frontend web developer programmer that can beat good challanges and solve some problems. I'm passionate about technology and how it can people's lives fastter, happy and inclusive.

I'm currently a student at Trybe, which is a programming school that teaches us how to learn the right way and how to solve problems using programming logic with baby steps.
I am currently in the backend module of the Trybe course where I will learn technologies such as Docker, MySQL, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, Typescript and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
